# 🤖 Distributed Reasoning Agent

## Overview
The **Distributed Reasoning Agent** is an AI-driven system designed to decompose complex problems into structured sub-tasks, assign them to intelligent sub-agents, and synthesize results into a comprehensive solution. By leveraging **LLMs (Groq API) with LangChain**, this system efficiently automates problem-solving workflows, making it an ideal tool for research, automation, and decision-making processes.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Problem Decomposition**: Breaks down a user-input problem into sub-tasks.
- **Dynamic Sub-Agent Creation**: Generates dedicated sub-agents with meaningful names for targeted problem-solving.
- **LLM-Powered Execution**: Each sub-agent processes its task through an advanced language model.
- **Intelligent Result Synthesis**: Aggregates sub-agent findings into a structured, high-level summary.
- **Interactive Console Logging**: Provides clear, step-by-step execution insights using **Rich** for enhanced visualization.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file and add your **Groq API Key**:
   ```sh
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Run the agent:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
4. Enter a problem statement when prompted and receive an intelligent breakdown and solution.

# System Design:

## **Architectural Overview**
The system follows a modular **multi-agent reasoning framework**, where an AI-powered main agent orchestrates the decomposition, delegation, execution, and synthesis of tasks using **LLMs (Groq API) with LangChain**.

## **Core Components**

### **1. User Interaction Module**
- Accepts a natural language problem statement from the user.
- Initiates the reasoning workflow via the `DistributedReasoningAgent`.

### **2. Problem Decomposition Engine**
- Utilizes AI to analyze and break down complex problems into structured sub-tasks.
- Generates a **maximum of 5** actionable sub-tasks.

### **3. Sub-Agent Management**
- Dynamically assigns **intelligent agent names** based on task requirements.
- Creates multiple `SubAgent` instances, each focused on a specific aspect of the problem.

### **4. Task Execution Module**
- Each sub-agent independently processes its assigned task using a large language model (LLM).
- Captures and logs insights for further synthesis.

### **5. Intelligent Result Synthesis**
- Aggregates and refines sub-agent outputs.
- Leverages an LLM to produce a **structured, insightful final solution**.
- Ensures clarity, coherence, and actionable recommendations.

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**
- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **LangChain** – LLM integration and orchestration
- **Groq API** – Advanced AI model execution
- **Rich** – Enhanced console-based visualization
- **Dotenv** – Secure environment variable management
