# 🤖 **Counterfactual Reasoning Agent**
A sophisticated Python-based agent that explores and evaluates "what-if" scenarios using Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool helps generate, analyze, and provide recommendations for counterfactual scenarios in decision-making processes.

## ✨ Key Features
- Generate multiple "what-if" scenarios for a given question.
- Evaluate each scenario using logical reasoning and probabilistic models.
- Stream responses from LLM API with proper error handling.
- Rich console output with formatted text and progress indicators.
- Automatic retry mechanism for API calls.
- Cost and time limit controls.
- Comprehensive logging system.

### 🎯 Scenario Generation
- Automatically generates multiple "what-if" scenarios based on the input question
- Limits the number of scenarios to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Validates and processes each scenario individually.

### 📊 Evaluation System
- Evaluates each scenario using LLM-powered analysis
- Provides detailed insights and potential impacts
- Combines evaluations for comprehensive recommendations

### 🛡️ Error Handling & Resilience
- Implements retry mechanism for API calls
- Handles JSON validation and processing errors
- Includes timeout and cost threshold controls

### 💻 Rich Console Output
- Progress indicators during scenario evaluation
- Formatted text output with color coding
- Markdown rendering support
- Comprehensive logging system

### ⚠️ Error Handling
The agent includes robust error handling:
- Retries failed API calls up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff between retry attempts
- JSON validation for API responses
- Cost threshold monitoring
- Time limit enforcement

### 📝 Logging
All operations are logged both to the console and a logfile.txt file, including:
- Scenario generation and evaluation progress
- Error messages and warnings
- Final recommendations
- Execution time
